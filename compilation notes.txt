when building the libmpeg2 project, and adding it to the mpeg2player project you may get error messages like...

.../mpeg2-player.csproj : XamlCompiler error WMC1006: Cannot resolve Assembly or Windows Metadata file 'Windows.Media.winmd'

to fix...
right click libmpeg2 project > configration properties > custom build steps
edit the line...
Command line to be...
mdmerge -partial -i "$(OutDir)." -o "$(OutDir)Output" -metadata_dir "$(WindowsSDK_MetadataPath)" && copy /y $(OutDir)Output\* $(OutDir)

if you get an error after adding the above - check that the & above have not become &amp;

There also appear to be a bug in "custom build steps" which means thay do not get executed unless there is something in the field[s]
'Additional Dependencies' & 'Treat Output as Content' so add to both...
echo AAAA

ALSO when building this project for RELEASE, change the linker field 'image has safe exception handle' to no, other wise the winmd file is not generated!
